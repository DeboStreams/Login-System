# Login-System | v1.0.2

### Thank you for checking out my login system!

#### There are some things we need to go over before you get started. You MUST have a folder called "shortcuts",
#### here you will place website shortcuts, executable shortcuts, or anything you want to be opened. Next you will have to go into the
#### code and change the file location of what you want to open and change the button text.

#### If you are having trouble feel free to dm me on discord:
